### Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Introduction to Neural Networks: In this part, I have learnt the basics of Neural Networks what they are and how they mimics the human brain's processing mechanisms.
Binary Classification: Learnt how to use logistic regression as a neural network and understanding the core concepts of classification.
Shallow Neural Networks: Building simple neural networks and exploring the backpropagation algorithm.
Deep Neural Networks: Understood the architecture of deep neural networks and how deeper layers can capture more complex features of data.
